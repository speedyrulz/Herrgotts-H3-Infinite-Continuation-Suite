# v1.2.1 validation notes

## Automated validation

The release regression suite covers:

- H3 temporal/phase-aligned latent timeline math.
- Stable-tail freeze detection and Auto Handover presets.
- No-Lock Fallback behavior.
- Direct AV continuation metadata and saved head-context metadata.
- Lazy/marker-gated runtime patch isolation and conflict detection.
- Full / Stitch Ready / Final Clip trim planning.
- Context-aligned video/audio seam math.
- 15 ms audio de-click crossfade duration and sample-exact A/V alignment.
- Safe Tail Bridge eligibility, safety-cap behavior and unchanged final timeline duration.
- Example-workflow model/VAE wiring and release seam defaults.

Current v1.2.1 release-candidate result: **68/68 regression tests passing**.

Run from the repository root:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

## Empirical ComfyUI validation before v1.2

- Balanced freeze detection was manually checked against roughly ten H3 clips and matched the visible freeze boundary very closely in those tests.
- Direct latent continuation preserved strong movement and native audio across boundaries.
- The phase-aligned extended context removed startup flicker seen with earlier arbitrary latent cut positions.
- A full three-clip showcase completed successfully with 243-frame segments, dynamic 22/26-frame continuation contexts and `Final Clip` preserving the last keyframe landing.
- Saved Chain Stitching completed on the same three saved clips with **617 video frames @ 24 fps**, **822667 audio samples @ 32000 Hz** and **A/V sample rounding delta 0**.
- The **15 ms audio de-click crossfade** was subjectively reported as seamless in live testing.
- A 4-frame video crossfade reduced the visible seam but left a small brightness change. Increasing it to 8 frames only spread that change over a longer interval.
- Boundary luminance matching successfully measured the decode-to-decode brightness difference, but live frame inspection showed that fading the gain could turn the seam into a visible brightness drift. It is therefore retained only as an experimental fallback and disabled by default in v1.2.

## v1.2 live Safe Tail Bridge validation

A seven-clip Saved Chain Stitching run completed successfully with:

- **1467 video frames @ 24 fps** = 61.125 s.
- **1,956,000 audio samples @ 32,000 Hz** = 61.125 s.
- **A/V sample rounding delta 0**.
- Safe Tail Bridge `2` frames at all six continuation joins.
- Video crossfade `4` frames, audio de-click crossfade `15 ms`, boundary luminance matching off.
- Subjective result reported as **very good**; a few isolated slightly brighter frames remained but were barely noticeable.

This validates the release-default Safe Tail Bridge timeline behavior across a longer seven-segment chain.

## v1.2.1 Manager metadata hotfix

The v1.2.1 patch adds two redundant identification paths for ComfyUI Manager:

1. `node_list.json` explicitly lists every registered node class.
2. Every suite node in every shipped workflow contains the Registry package ID `herrgotts-h3-infinite-continuation-suite`, version `1.2.1`, and an exact `Node name for S&R` matching its workflow node type.

No generation, freeze-detection, continuation, stitching or runtime-patch logic changed in v1.2.1.
